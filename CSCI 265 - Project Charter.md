## Project intro:

Our product is a website that predicts and tracks the menstrual cycles with the addition of helpful information and resources to better help women with any problems they may encounter.

## Team philosophy:

## Team roles/responsibilities:

The team roles have been broken up into 2 parts part 1 is their main responsibilities under the header main roles, and part 2 is their substudys which means if another team member needs help or something slips through the cracks we can quickly get someone assigned to it based on understood strengths discussed in our first meeting and online discussion.

When we have a meeting each team member or member will give a summary of what they have been doing to move forward, then show via email or pictures through Discord their progress and problems. This is also a chance for the member to state how they are feeling about their assignment (ie overworked, underworked…..)  Through these summaries, we can make sure everyone is adequately up to date and we can relieve any major problem hopefully before they start.

## Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

Tuesday and Thursday meetings, communication through Discord and email, Xia can’t come on Tuesday.  
The team's primary communication mechanism outside of meetings will be through a discord server to be set up and  
managed by the organizational lead. All team members are expected to check the server daily and to  
respond to queries promptly. All team members have shared their contact information via email and text if more urgent communication is needed.  
The primary weekly meeting time will be Mondays 5-6 pm, with a shorter meeting held each Friday after the lab. The  
preference is to have all team members attend in person, but Zoom is an option if someone is unable to  
be there in person.  
For each Monday meeting the organizational lead will set an agenda (posted to the discord) at least 48 hours in  
advance so team members have a chance to prepare for any discussions around their lead/understudy roles. As  
mentioned earlier, each meeting will begin by having each team member give a short update on their recent and  
upcoming work and any problems/issues encountered, expected, or resolved.  
The organizational understudy will take notes at each meeting, summarizing the topics discussed and any decisions  
made during the meeting. These notes will be posted to the discord for future reference and for anyone   
unable to attend the meeting.  
While missing a meeting once or twice in the term is expected (and often unavoidable), if a team member is regularly  
absent that becomes a much bigger cause for concern and will be brought up with the individual involved (by  
discord, email, or text if they cannot be found in person). If the problem persists then the issue will be raised with the  
course instructor.

## Deadlines and deliverables

The Monday meetings are the primary planning point for the current and upcoming deadlines, with the short Friday  
sessions providing a chance to check that everything is proceeding as planned. As a team we have agreed that each  
person will have their parts of each deliverable completed and turned over to the group at least a full 24 hours prior  
to the deadline, with 48 hours being the preferred target.  
For documentation components the organizational lead is the point person to do a final check before submission, for  
coding components it is the development lead, and for the lab presentations it is the presentation lead. (With the  
corresponding understudy members assisting as needed.)  
As with missed meetings, missing a deadline once may be forgivable (depending on the circumstances), but  
repeatedly missing deadlines puts an unfair load and stress on the other team members. Should the need arise, we  
will attempt to resolve this in team meetings first, with a fallback plan of bringing the situation to the instructor's  
attention.

## Conflict resolution scheme

As per the opening discussion on team philosophy, we hope that most disagreements can be resolved by open-  
minded discussion. In the event that not all parties can reach agreement then the matter will be decided by an in-  
meeting vote. In the event of a tie the lead for the relevant role casts the tie-breaking vote and all team members  
have agreed to abide by this process.  
Team AI policies  
Some members of the team do not wish the rights/integrity of the product content to be compromised by either  
feeding content into an AI or by embedding AI-generated content into the product. As such the team members are in  
agreement that AI use for the project will be restricted to investigatory applications, e.g.:  
exploring possible languages, features, tools, technologies, and techniques  
getting clarification on the correct use of languages, tools, etc  
investigating error messages (but not through copying code content into the AI)  
Intellectual property rights  
All members of the team are regarded as equal holders in the project IP rights.  
The team has unanimously agreed that team members can use the project content as part of their portfolios, but no  
other use of any project content is permitted outside the course without the explicit consent of all team members in  
advance.

## Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses

Group strengths:

- Some of the members have prior experience in HTML work  
- All members are committed and responsible for our project   
- Good communication between team members to offer constructive criticism

Group weakness:

- Most of us do not have experience in larger projects.  
- Limited experience with various programming languages.  
- All group members have very busy schedules which could lead to crunched deadlines
