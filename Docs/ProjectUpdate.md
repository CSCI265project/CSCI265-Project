## **Key Revisions since Phase 2:**

---

One significant functional addition to the product requirements and some fixes/enhancements to the requirements and standards document have been made. Those changes are summarized below. 

**Changes to the Requirements:**   
We realized that we missed one of the most important parts of the registration process: adding the date of their most recent period, as without this, the calendar cannot work properly. 

**Changes to Standards:**  
We realized that our Docs Branch was not needed. We needed a Docs directory, so now our GitHub server is more clearly laid out with a Docs directory in the main branch. We also added another sub-directory for images in the Docs Directory.

**Requirements Document Updates:**   
The screen menus and navigation section, specifically the registration screen section, have been edited accordingly. The registration process now includes an input of the last period date and the Requirements document has been altered accordingly. Also, details of some requirements, like algorithms and inputs, are specified instead of generalized.

**Standards Document Updates:**  
We have updated the phase 2 Standards document. We defined how and where the docs directory would be and where the images sub-directory would be. The main branch has now also been described. The docs and image directories reside in the main branch. Outside of storing the docs and image directorys, the main branch can hold other miscellaneous things not suitable for the 3 more coding-focused branches( ie: Development, testing, and production).
