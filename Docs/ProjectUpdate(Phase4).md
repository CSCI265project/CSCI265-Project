**Key revisions since Phase 3**

While the charter and standards have remained unchanged, a number of key revisions have been made to the product requirements and design, largely related to the list of ‘known issues’ provided in the phase 3 version of the design document.

**Changes to requirements:** 

* Now requirements have an updated version of the sketches in which a log-out button is visible on the top right corner. The sketches of the registration and login pages have also been added

**Changes to design:** 

* The login and setting account process have additional clarifications: the log is the page the user finds when they go to the public address, to register they just have to click on the link below, and once registered they are sent once again to the login page (Section 1.4)  
* Clarification of databases: There are three databases, the registration database (containing all the information of registration), the verification database (containing the codes to verify the account), and the notification which contains the email and next notification date.  
* An ERD model has been added showing the database relationships.  
* A new architectural model for the website has been added.
