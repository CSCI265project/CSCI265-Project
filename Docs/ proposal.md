**Project Overview**

In today’s world, integrating health with technology has brought multiple benefits, such as increased accessibility, data-driven insights, cost efficiency, and better diagnostics. Fitness apps that track steps, provide diet charts and create personalized exercise routines have gained popularity due to their efficiency and accessibility.

Focusing on women’s health and unique needs, our website C-Clo, is a period-tracking platform designed to help women stay informed and prepared for their next cycle. Users can register themselves via email. The website will ask a few questions about their cycle dates, duration, symptoms and whether their cycle is regular or irregular. After processing this information, our product will analyze the data and create an accurate 6-month prediction of their menstrual cycle. Notifications and friendly reminders will be sent to the users via email when their period is approaching or when there are any health tips to be shared. The website will function on a user-friendly interface enabling users to navigate its features and view their cycle calendar with ease.

In addition to that, our website will provide menstrual hygiene tips and insights into various menstrual products and their proper use. The website will allow users to record symptoms such as abdominal pain, mood swings, and cramps providing a more detailed understanding of their menstrual cycle.

**To Summarize**

**·**   	The website will generate a personalized cycle calendar that will accurately predict your menstrual cycle for 6 months.

·   The website will send users friendly reminders and notifications about the cycle phases and health tips

· Additional information about menstrual health and hygiene products will be provided

 The objective of this platform is to help women monitor and manage their periods efficiently. To assist users in handling menstrual symptoms, identifying patterns and recognizing any irregularities.

**Target audience and motivation**

Integrating menstrual health with technology will help individuals address the subject more openly and better understand their cycle. This integration also facilitates body analysis, which plays a crucial role in managing one’s health efficiently.

Women need to have an easy and accessible platform where they can manage their menstrual cycles and access health-related information, reducing the need for manual recording. It is important to raise awareness among young girls about their bodily changes and help them understand their menstrual health. Individuals must have a platform that can identify early irregularities indicative of potential health conditions, encouraging early medical consultations.

The website will primarily target women aged between 13 and 45\. By addressing the needs of both teenagers and adults, the website intends to provide support throughout various stages of reproductive health.

**Key features and Discussions**

In the modern world, managing menstrual health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being. Our period-tracking website aims to empower individuals by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform to monitor and manage their menstrual cycles effectively. By integrating advanced features tailored to the needs of our users, the website will offer not only a reliable way to track menstrual cycles but also valuable insights and support for reproductive health.

The website is designed to cater to a diverse range of users, from those who seek a basic period tracker to those who desire in-depth analysis and personalized health recommendations.

**Preliminary Interface sketches:**

Mock-ups of the main page and registration page are shown below, as well as other sections of the web page. These are preliminary images of what the design might look like, although it is subject to changes. 

**First sketch of the registering** 

The registering page shows different data that the user has to input. This includes their personal information such as name, email, and age. Next, it defines the user's menstrual cycle based on the type of flow (low, medium, heavy), the regularity of their period, and the duration of it (3 \- 7 days). Finally, it asks the user whether to allow the notifications when their menstruation cycle might start. 

**First sketch of the home page** 

The home page contains the menu options of our period tracker to access the different sections included, like the period calendar, symptoms and mood form, health insights and tips, and educational sources. Below the menu options, it displays the current day the user is in their cycle, and it gives the option to add the current date as their start of period and/or to report any symptoms during their period if they have.

**First sketch of the period calendar**

The calendar highlights in red the days that it predicts the user is going to initialize their menstrual cycle. The objective is to make predictions for up to 6 months. Additionally, predictions of the ovulation cycle might as well be included on the web page. 

**Scaling Options:** 

This is the team’s first attempt to develop a web page with such complexity which makes it uncertain which goals are going to be achievable and which ones are likely to be incomplete or not even initiated.   
Therefore, we have established three sections of goals for our project: the core elements that are going to be included, the set of stretch goals that might be included depending on the time left, and the secondary features that might be omitted if there is not enough time to complete them.   
      
**Core elements:**

* User registration and profile setup with personal data and menstrual cycle characteristics.   
* Period Calendar and cycle predictions according to the data provided in the profile setup.   
* Symptoms and mood logging along with recommendations, solutions, and advice for such cases.  
* Health insights and tips to avoid and/or recognize any infection or disease  
* Reminders of upcoming menstrual cycles and reports of any abnormalities such as late or early periods   
* Privacy and Security of the data provided by the user   
* Educational resources and support, targeted mostly at girls who have just started their menstrual cycle    
* Features for the website design and functionality and customized themes  


  
**Stretch goals:**

* Increase of predictions up to 12 months including as well the ovulation cycle   
* Increase information sources to build a more reliable database   
* Predictions of symptoms beforehand based on other data such as weight, height, size, etc.   
* AI chat that also provides advice in a more dynamic way   
* Greater support for the amount of users logged in at the same time 


**Secondary features:**

* Focus on building and improving the symptoms form and omitting the mood form  
* The predictions will decrease only to 3 months   
* The information database will decrease the amount of sources that were set to include  
* The idea of a discussion forum where users can interact with each other to provide advice will be omitted

**Risks and Potential Issues:**

From the usability aspect, mostly women will be using the website, which decreases the target audience compared to other web pages or programs. However, since one of our goals is to include men in the conversation, future versions might contain features for such purposes. Another problem that we face is the amount of users that can log in before our pages crash, which reduces the reliability of our product.

As in programming risks, the different sections that we need to create have to work perfectly by themselves and as part of the overall website, which is a complex process as there are many sections that we have to work on.  
   
Potential risks from the ethical part of the website include the use of the internet by teenagers as they can encounter many dangers on the web since they are in an environment with multiple strangers, in the worst case scenario, our webpage can lead to pedophilia cases. On the other hand, the information we expect to provide on our website comes from reliable sources but it is hard to guarantee that some research might not conflict with other sources.
